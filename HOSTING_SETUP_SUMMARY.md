We've successfully prepared your ShopKart project for production deployment! Here's what was configured:

### 1. Production Dependencies Added

- ✅ `dj-database-url==2.1.0` - Database URL configuration
- ✅ `python-decouple==3.8` - Environment variable management

### 2. Deployment Configuration Files Created

**File: `Procfile`**
- Tells hosting platforms how to start your web server
- Command: `web: gunicorn shoeskart.wsgi --log-file -`

**File: `runtime.txt`**
- Specifies Python version: `python-3.13.7`
- Ensures consistent environment across deployments

**File: `.env`**

- Template showing required environment variables
- Safe to commit as a reference

### 3. Updated Django Settings
**File: `shoeskart/settings.py`**

### Option 3: Other Platforms

- **Heroku**: See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md#deploy-to-heroku)
- **PythonAnywhere**: See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md#deploy-to-pythonanywhere)

---

## ⚠️ Before Deploying - Important!

### 1. Commit Your Changes

First, push all the new configuration files to GitHub:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Add production deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Generate New SECRET_KEY for Production

**Don't use the default key in production!** Generate a new one:

```powershell
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

Copy the output and use it as your `SECRET_KEY` environment variable on the hosting platform.

### 3. Prepare Environment Variables

When deploying, you'll need to set these environment variables:

```
SECRET_KEY=<your-new-generated-secret-key>
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=<your-app-domain>
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_ROdO6CGivLBaVf
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=hpwho4yrEQ4BW1B0mQBMDlt3
```

Replace `<your-app-domain>` with your actual domain (e.g., `shopkart.onrender.com`)

---

## 🔧 After Deployment

Once your site is live, you'll need to:

1. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Create Admin User**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

3. **Collect Static Files**
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

4. **Upload Products**
   - Visit `https://your-domain.com/admin`
   - Login with superuser credentials
   - Add products, categories, etc.

4. **Test locally first** - Run `python manage.py runserver` to verify
5. **Read the logs** - If something fails, check platform logs
6. **Be patient** - First deployment takes 5-10 minutes
