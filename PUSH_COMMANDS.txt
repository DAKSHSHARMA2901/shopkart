# ========================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# ========================================
# 1. You'll need to create a repository named 'shopkart' on GitHub first
#    Go to: https://github.com/new
#    Repository name: shopkart
#    Description: Modern e-commerce platform built with Django
#    Make it Public or Private (your choice)
#    DO NOT initialize with README
#
# 2. When it asks for authentication, use:
#    Username: DAKSHSHARMA2901
#    Password: Your Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)
#
# 3. If you don't have a Personal Access Token:
#    - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
#    - Generate new token (classic)
#    - Select 'repo' scope
#    - Copy the token and use it as password
#
# ========================================
# ALTERNATIVE: If you get authentication errors
# ========================================
# Use GitHub CLI or GitHub Desktop instead:
# - GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
# - Or use SSH keys
